  # The most common configuration options are documented and commented below.
  # For a complete reference, please see the online documentation at
  # https://docs.vagrantup.com.

  # Every Vagrant development environment requires a box. You can search for
  # boxes at https://atlas.hashicorp.com/search.
  config.vm.box = "bento/ubuntu-16.04"

  # Disable automatic box update checking. If you disable this, then
  # boxes will only be checked for updates when the user runs
  # `vagrant box outdated`. This is not recommended.
  # config.vm.box_check_update = false

  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.
  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080

  # Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine
  # using a specific IP.
  # config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"

  # Create a public network, which generally matched to bridged network.
  # Bridged networks make the machine appear as another physical device on
  # your network.
  # config.vm.network "public_network"

  # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is
  # the path on the host to the actual folder. The second argument is
  # the path on the guest to mount the folder. And the optional third
  # argument is a set of non-required options.
  # config.vm.synced_folder "../data", "/vagrant_data"

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    vb.name = "qtdevel"
    vb.linked_clone = true

    # Display the VirtualBox GUI when booting the machine.
    vb.gui = true
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--vram", "12"]
    # Qt Creator doesn't currently work with 3D acceleration.
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--accelerate3d", "off"]
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--accelerate2dvideo", "off"]

    # Customize the amount of memory on the VM.
    vb.memory = "2048"

    ### Use VBoxManage to customize the VM.
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--clipboard", "bidirectional"]
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--natdnshostresolver1", "on"]
    ### Fix a bug enabling network interfaces
    ### https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/6871
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--cableconnected1", "on"]
  end
  #
  # View the documentation for the provider you're using for more
  # information on available options.

  # Define a Vagrant Push strategy for pushing to Atlas. Other push strategies
  # such as FTP and Heroku are also available. See the documentation at
  # https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/push/atlas.html for more information.
  # config.push.define "atlas" do |push|
  #   push.app = "YOUR_ATLAS_USERNAME/YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME"
  # end

  # Enable provisioning with a shell script. Additional provisioners such as
  # Puppet, Chef, Ansible, Salt, and Docker are also available. Please see the
  # documentation for more information about their specific syntax and use.
  # config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
  #   sudo apt-get update
  #   sudo apt-get install -y apache2

  ### If true, then any SSH connections made will enable agent forwarding.

  ### Configure provisioning

  ### Copy the user Git configuration to the new VM.
  if File.exists? File.expand_path("~/.gitconfig")
    config.vm.provision "file" do |file|
      file.source = "~/.gitconfig"
      file.destination = "~/.gitconfig"
    end
  end

  ###
  ### Run Ansible from the Vagrant VM
  config.vm.provision "ansible_local" do |ansible|
    ansible.playbook = "provisioning/playbook.yml"
    ansible.galaxy_role_file = "provisioning/requirements.yml"
    ansible.install = true

#      :desktop_session => "gnome-flashback-metacity",   # Ubuntu Classic without effects
      :desktop_session => "ubuntu",                    # Ubuntu Unity
